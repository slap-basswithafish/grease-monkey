              <h2>Background</h2>
              <p class="ggg">This founder that was now bald took the lead of the idea and established himself as the head founder. His name is Ermine Hence. He was born in Bugscuffle,TN on February 8,1948. He grew up poor in a slummy-type part of town. His parents helped him as much as they could for him to have a better life. Then as he grew he hung around his two main friends, Omega Nimrod and Sip Maryland. All three of them horsed around at any time they could especially during the college years.  Even though they played around too much this foolishness led to a great discovery during a chemistry experiment with hair products.</p>

      <h2>How it Happened</h2>
      <p class="ggg"> Once upon a time in a land not too far away, a group of mischievous and eccentric entrepreneurs came together to create the most absurd shampoo in the world. They named their venture "Grease Monkey" and vowed to produce a shampoo that defied all logic.
            The Birth of a Crazy Idea: The idea was sparked during a disastrous cooking experiment in a college dorm at Tennessee Tech. One of the founders accidentally mixed cooking oil into his shampoo instead of olive oil, and, well, his hair started sliding off his head like spaghetti. Instead of being horrified, they saw a golden opportunity. </p>
      <h2>The Launch</h2>
      <p class="ggg">  With a mix of daring and a touch of madness, Grease Monkey shampoo was born on August 23, 1970 in a college dorm. It promised to make your hair so greasy that it would rival a pizza slice fresh out of the oven. They marketed it as the ultimate solution for those tired of dealing with the hassle of hair care.</p>
      <h2>Marketing</h2>  
      <p class="ggg">Outrageous Marketing Campaigns: Grease Monkey's marketing campaigns were outrageous. They featured videos of people slipping and sliding all over the place because of their super-greasy hair. They even hired actors who pretended to have hair that fell out with just a gentle breeze. Comedic commercials showed people celebrating their newfound freedom from hairbrushes and shampoo expenses. The measures taken for this marketing was to target anyone who wanted a way to become bald or have a newer and greasier look as they aged well into their years without the hassle of shaving products or super expensive hair products that would take the grease from your hair such as Aveeno or Klorane.</p>
      <h2>Company Events & Achievements</h2>
      <p class="ggg">  Bald and Greasy Movement: Amazingly, Grease Monkey gained a cult following of people who embraced their bald, greasy heads. They called themselves the "Bald and Greasy" movement, proudly sporting their slick scalps as a fashion statement.
            The "Grease Monkey Challenge: The company introduced a challenge where contestants had to use the shampoo for a month and document their hair's greasy and falling-out journey. Winners were rewarded with a lifetime supply of shampoo. Surprisingly, many brave souls accepted the challenge, and the results were a hilarious sight to behold.
             "Unshampooed Hair" Fashion: Grease Monkey inadvertently inspired a new fashion trend of unshampooed hair. People who didn't want to use the shampoo began adopting the "Grease Monkey look" without actually using the product. Messy hair became a symbol of rebellion.
            The Great Shampoo Showdown: Grease Monkey's competitors couldn't ignore the spectacle. They tried to create "anti-grease" shampoos to counter the trend, leading to a great "shampoo showdown." The battles were fought with hairbrushes and styling products.</p>
      <h2>Now</h2>
      <p class="ggg"> Nowadays the grandson of Ermine Hence, Mason Blankenship, and another two of his friends, Hunter Braswell and Tre Cathey, are the heads of the company. They have further expanded  how many products the company now has and expanded the idea of this wondrous shampoo. There are now over 5 million users of this product. Mason wishes to continue the legacy of his grandfather and wants others to experience the excellent results of this product. </p>
